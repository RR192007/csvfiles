Its EPS price target is good. Its But its moving averages show 20%. It is below its 200 day SMA. Both its MACDs are bearish. Its RSI is at 46, which may show further decrease in price. So the techicals are bad. Its 1 year and 3 year returns are terrible. 5 year returns although are good. This may not be a good stock in this industry.<br>Siemens is better with 60% moving averages, better 3 year returns, a lower P/E, though by a small margin. RSI is at 56, which doesn't say much. Its price target seems okay.","Honeywell vs Siemens, which is better in the Cap. Goods Industry?"
