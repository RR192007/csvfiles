It moved up 4 rupees to close at 280 on Friday's surge.","ITC has a good P/E and a neutral RSI, TI's Moving Average Score is 100% and both MACDs are bullish, it may not have good returns or a good EPS target but currently its technicals are saying buy. After Q4 reports on Friday, ITC should be a good investment at least for the short term, anywhere between 2 months to a year.<br>Trading Idea: Buy now at around 280, maybe lower, but don't go higher than 282. Potential Upside based on Moving Averages is 25%.<br>In other news, the losses investors faced on Thursday were reversed on Friday, with the Sensex going up more than 1500 points.","This stock hasn't moved much in the past 5 years. But now it goes 8% up to its 52W High. Should you buy shares of the Indian Tobacco Company?"
