Should you buy?","JSW Steel's price target is great, its P/E is low. Its RSI also doesn't say much. Though its 5 year returns are good, 1 and 3 year returns are terrible. This stock is 100% bearish (Source: TI) and it has slipped below its 200 day Moving Average, which indicates a lot of trouble for this stock. It may disrupt its 52W high, based on its 50 day average. Its 200-day average is showing a price target of 434, considerably lower than the current price of 572. Its quarterly EPS has gone down, but its annual EPS is more than double of what it was. The company could face problems like the latest steel collapse, but also in the wake of another COVID-19 wave or even the possibility of a lockdown, car manufacturing would be disrupted, which could hamper the cashflow and income of this company. However, its income has been good since FY 2020, and now 2022 was a huge jump. This stock could do well for the long term. It may be a fabulous asset in your portfolio, but it is a high risk investment and low risk investors should not buy it.","JSW Steel up 30 paise. Buy?"
