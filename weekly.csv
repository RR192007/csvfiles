HAL.NS,"http://www.trendistics.com/markets/predict?symbol=Hindustan%20Aeronautics%20Limited%20[HAL]%20|%20National%20Stock%20Exchange%20of%20India","HAL was 1.8% clear of Thursday's price. Should you buy this Defence Bluechip?","HAL's P/E shows that it is considerably reasonably priced. Its EPS price target is fabulous. Its 5, 10, 20, 50 and 100-day moving averages show bullish. Both its MACDs are bullish. Its RSI is at 57, which is also good. So the techicals are fabulous.<br>Trading Idea: Buy now at around the current price, maybe lower, but don't go higher than 1800. Potential Upside based on Moving Averages is around 33% even at an 1800 average.<br>However, the inflation led bearish trend that is taking place could pose problems. Not only for this stock, but many other stocks. The NIFTY 50's has shown resistance in the past around 15500, but if it manages to cross that 15500 breakout, recovery may be a problem and it could even sink to 14500. The Sensex has its resistance at around 52800. However, the charts are showing one thing, even after a bearish Three Black Crows Pattern IT and Financials have posted two days of gains. Further gains may follow, after M&M's strong Q4. The decision will be taken this week. Will the Sensex collapse further and hit 52800 or will it manage to climb at then further touch the resistance level of 55580-56000.","Buy HAL?"
